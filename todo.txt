TODOs:
 o MATLAB callback, output primal-dual gap in ex_rof.m
 o Diagonal Preconditioner Options (off/on/equilibration), only "off" for now
 o Adaptive Steps for PDHG backend
 o Stopping Criterion
 o Reference MATLAB implementation of backends/proxs for debugging?
 o Simplex Projection prox, CCP multilabel example, denoising/stereo
 o Multi-GPU implementation
 o Epigraph prox, continuous relaxation 
 o Adapt to google C++ style guide, use lint?
 o run with valgrind/gdb to check for memleaks
