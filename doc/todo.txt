TODOs:
 o Add check if prox operators cover the whole primal/dual domain
 o Simplex Projection prox, lifted rof denoising/stereo
 o Write helper functions for interleaved index calculation and double
 => real conversion
 o Diagonal Preconditioning a la Pock
 o Epigraph prox, continuous relaxation

 o Test Moreau prox
 o Stopping Criterion
 o Write proper error handling/checking code
 o Resolve all TODOs in code
 o Implement debug/verbose flag where solver outputs lots of stuff
 o Write CMakeLists.txt and pdsolver_build.m properly so it builds
   nicely everywhere
 o Check coding style with lint
 o Investigate why everything crashes when MATLAB GUI is on but works
   with console
 o Reference MATLAB implementation of backends/proxs for debugging?
 o run with valgrind to check for memleaks
 o Graph Projection Splitting backend with preconditioned CG solver
 o Check for Memory Leaks and Out-Of-Bounds accesses in CUDA kernels.
 o Add doxygen comments
 o -Werror, -Wall compiler flags
 o Unit tests for prox operators, etc

Done:
 x Adapt to google C++ style guide
 x MATLAB callback, output primal-dual gap in ex_rof.m
 x Output Memory Requirement for Solver
 x Diagonal Preconditioner Options (off/on/equilibration), only "off" for now
 x ProxNorm2 is broken, fix it
 x Test with double precision
 x Adaptive Steps for PDHG backend

TODO prox:
 o constraint sets from lifting papers
 o nuclear norm
 o x^T A x + b^T x + c
 o second order cone projection
 o halfspace
 o linear operator (1/2) ||Ax-b||^2 with cuFFT
 o linear operator (preconditioned) conjugate gradient
 o elastic net
 o projection onto epigraph of x^T A x + b^T x + c?
 o l_infty norms, full l1 ball
 o general function of singular values?
 o mixed matrix norms
 o (nonconvex nuclear norm)
 o (l^q (0<=q<infty) 1d, nuclear & 2-norm)
 o (mumford-shah 1d & 2-norm)
 o (smooth mumford-shah 1d & 2-norm)
